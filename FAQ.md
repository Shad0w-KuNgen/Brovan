<summary><b>Why not just use a VM or QEMU?</b></summary>

---

QEMU and VMs in general are great for running software in a realistic environment, but that also means you are often at the mercy of the kernel and the rest of the system underneath it.

For example, in Brovan you can silently intercept and log every memory read of a specific variable without modifying the binary, patching page tables, or triggering any signal the target process could detect directly. something fundamentally impossible in a real kernel or main-stream VMs, where any attempt to trap such accesses would require invasive kernel changes or debug registers visible to the program.

Also full kernel emulation is especially expensive, both in performance and in implementation complexity. A lot of low-level behavior has to be modeled just to keep the system running, even when the analysis does not need all of it.

Brovan is designed around analysis, observability, and control. It also aims to stay efficient by reducing allocations and using stack allocations where possible, it might not be perfect everywhere since the project is being built and maintained by one person.

The goal is to make it easier to inspect, modify, and instrument execution for reverse engineering, malware analysis, and binary research.

**In short:**
- Use QEMU or a VM when you want a general-purpose environment to run software.
- Use Brovan when you want deep visibility, fine-grained control, and analysis-first workflows.

<summary><b>How does Brovan enforce sandboxing?</b></summary>

---

Brovan is designed so that emulated binaries have very limited interaction with the host system.

At a high level, the primary way a binary can interact with the host is through file access. Networking is disabled except for loopback connections by default, and network access is controlled explicitly through the `--net` command-line argument.

**For filesystem access:**
* Write operations are always redirected and isolated from the host filesystem.
* Path traversal attempts are blocked.
* Symlink-based escapes are prevented.
* Direct writes to host files are not permitted.

Read access is more permissive, but only when the host environment is compatible with the emulated binary. When compatibility requirements are not met, filesystem operations generally fall back to Brovan's VirtualFS implementation instead.

This design allows software to access the resources it needs while reducing the risk of unintended modification of the host system and maintaining a controlled analysis environment.

<summary><b>What's up with Brovan and Control Flow Guard?</b></summary>

---

As most of unicorn users would know, the emulator's JIT (TCG) doesn't support CFG because of the way it jumps to the generated code, which is incompatible with the mitigation.

Currently unicorn doesn't have a fix, and looks like it won't come any time soon, as looks like they have other issues in the engine that they want to take care of.

All unicorn programs running on windows, if they need to do anything real with unicorn, it needs to disable CFG. not just Brovan. this is usually done via the project settings and isn't ever mentioned, but the reason it is mentioned in Brovan is because the .NET Compiler doesn't support controlling the linker directly, so it is mentioned so people are aware.

The post-build automatically disables it when building for Windows via editbin.exe, it can also restart the process with the mitigation disabled.
